# what is complexity

Wikipedia has a nice overview on [complex systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system).

_Complexity Explained_
by Peter Erdi
This book offers a broad view on complexity in a variety of topics. He refers or levels up his book to Dennet's Consciousness Explained if that's a measure. (Note: a bit heavy on the math.)

_Think Complexity_
by Allen Downey
Has a focus on coding and algorithms.

Both of these books can be found at the 'regular outlets'.

## Kolmogorov complexity

The Kolmogorov complexity (Andrey Kolmogorov, 1963) of an object, like a piece of text, is the length of the shortest computer program (in a predetermined programming language) that produces the object as output.

It is a measure of the computational resources needed to specify the object, and is also known as algorithmic complexity, Solomonoff–Kolmogorov–Chaitin complexity, program-size complexity, descriptive complexity, or algorithmic entropy. 

Kolmogorov complexity can be used to state and **prove** impossibility results like Gödel's incompleteness theorem, Turing's halting problem, and Cantor's diagonal argument. For almost all objects, it is not possible to compute its Kolmogorov complexity.
