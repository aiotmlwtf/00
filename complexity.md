# what is
complexity

Wikipedia has a nice overview on [complex systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system).

Think Complexity by Allen Downey
has a focus on coding and algorithms.

## Kolmogorov complexity

The Kolmogorov complexity (Andrey Kolmogorov, 1963) of an object, like a piece of text, is the length of the shortest computer program (in a predetermined programming language) that produces the object as output.

It is a measure of the computational resources needed to specify the object, and is also known as algorithmic complexity, Solomonoff–Kolmogorov–Chaitin complexity, program-size complexity, descriptive complexity, or algorithmic entropy. 

Kolmogorov complexity can be used to state and **prove** impossibility results like Gödel's incompleteness theorem, Turing's halting problem, and Cantor's diagonal argument. For almost all objects, it is not possible to compute its Kolmogorov complexity.
