## random
The absense of pattern or predictability.

## randomness
A measure of uncertainty of an outcome, rather than the perceived lack of order. A random sequence of events, symbols or steps often has no order and does not follow an intelligible pattern or combination.  Randomness exists when some outcomes occur without any order, unpredictably, or by chance. These notions are distinct, but they all have a close connection to probability. Individual random events are unpredictable, but since they often follow a **probability distribution**, the frequency of different outcomes over numerous events (or "trials") **is** predictable: when throwing two dice, the outcome of any particular roll is unpredictable, but a sum of 7 will occur twice as often as 4.


## probability
A numerical measure of likeliness of an event to occur, or a proposition to be true. 
The higher the probability of an event, the more likely it is that the event will occur. Probability is a number between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates impossibility and 1 indicates certainty. 

## pseudo-random
Long but finite string of random numbers.
100% deterministic in principal, but, depending on application, passes as random (used by computers) when reading of the string starts at a random position. When reading from the same position however,
a pseudo-random generator will output an identical string.

## randomness vs chance

Chance and randomness overlap in many cases, but are separate concepts. Randomness, chance, predictability are used interchangeably, the ordinary way that the word ‘random’ gets used is akin to ‘chancy’: *Something is random if it happens by chance.* src: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chance-randomness 
mathematical randomness, product randomness (KML-randomness) vs. physical chance, process randomness, (chanciness)

  Observations of mathematically non-random sequences can be used to decide when further explanation in terms of as yet undiscovered causal factors is needed. But, Mathematical randomness can't explain ‘ultimate physical randomness’, whatever that might be. 
The link between mathematical and physical randomness is epistemic (knowledge-based, cognitive, mental) only. 

eg. from a textbook on evolution:
	'scientists use chance, or randomness, to mean that when physical causes can result in any of several outcomes, we cannot predict what the outcome will be in any particular case'

[Check Carvalhais](/bibliography), he has a good chapter on randomness.
