# what is creativity

Boden in The Creative Mind

### notes
Can evolution be seen as being creative?
Yes, noise in the mutations lead to new novel properties.

Hard to find difference in datasets, but not similarities.
Problem is then the need to define difference.

Noise coming into the system is essential for new stuff to appear.
