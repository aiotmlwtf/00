*“In the computer field, the moment of truth is a
running program; all else is prophecy.”*
 Herbert Simon

## introduction
AIOTMLWTF 0.1a was an eight day course/workshop at the ArtScience Interfaculty of the Royal Academy of Art and Royal Conservatory in The Hague Netherlands exploring current and historic aspects of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and more in general an introduction in computational arts.

The educational model is collaborative learning. By this we mean all participants and teachers share their knowledge with the group in short seminars taking from 01 minutes to an hour or more.

Further, we offer a playground for exploration with state of the art AI computer systems; i.e. the NVidia Jetson Nano boards.

We hope these weeks will deliver on some unexpected journeys and outcomes. Check the schedule on the left for a preliminary outline of the course.

Have fun!
Arthur Elsenaar & Jan Kees van Kampen
