### Benthall, Jonathan (1972) Science and Technology in Art Today

Again a classic text on art and technology with a view from the late 1960's.

|| blurp
The relationship of science and technology to creativity is becoming increasingly important in an age when art in the traditional sense, and in the traditional media, seems to be in the midst of an identity crisis. Jonathan Benthall first looks at the exciting new media that the age of technology offers the artist, singling out for special attention the digital computer and the bewildering new technique of laser holography. Like painting and photography, these recent innovations act as extensions of man's capacity to organize and convey information.
Benthall then goes on to explore the creative implications of the study of the interactions between organism and environment. The result of his observations is a new approach to kinetic art and to some relationships between art and language. Ecology is far more than a modish word: it involves a new way of seeing the world. And there are some men doing things we may not yet even identify as art, such as Hans Haacke, Sonfist and Negroponte, who are in a strong position to interpret and influence. The book's theme - art as organization of resources - is especially relevant and optimistic, at a time when gloomy prognostications of the ''death of art'' can be heard on every side.

|| preface
The subject of this book is complex. I have tried to avoid unsupported generalizations, inessential technical detail, and personal polemic. I have treated very lightly the historical background to the present 'art and technology' or 'science in art' movement -for instance, the Bauhaus, the early Soviet avant-garde, etc.; partly because this background has been amply documented by other authors (to whose works references are given), and partly because I feel the most urgent need is for a fresh approach.
Chapters One to Four are largely concerned with the relationship between art and media, focusing on three media: photography, the computer, and laser holography. In Chapter Five, which is primarily a study of kinetic art and some of its repercussions, the emphasis shifts from media to expression. Chapters Six and Seven are devoted to some implications of ecology and linguistics, respectively, for art and culture. Chapter Eight reviews some aspects of the relationship between science and art, arguing that this relationship can best be understood if art is regarded primarily as a mode of enquiry.
I considered adding a final chapter on 'Social Responsibility in Science and in Art', but decided that if my conception of social responsibility means anything it would be implicit in the texture of the whole book. I take as a starting-point the fact that many people in both science and art are trying to relate their work more tellingly to the problems of society as a whole. I sympathize with those who resort to political activism; but for me there are underlying issues of creativity and community which claim first attention.

|| Abstract
There are various forms of what’s sometimes called generative art, or computer art. This paper distinguishes the major categories and asks whether the appropriate aesthetic criteria—and the locus of creativity—are the same in each case.

### Colakides, Yiannis; Garrett, Marc; Gloerich, Inte (eds.) (2019) State Machines Reflections and Actions at the Edge of Digital Citizenship Finance and Art

For this course, check out the article HOW TO HACK ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE by Francis Hunger.

|| Introduction snippet
The use of digital technology to reinforce state ideology is not restricted to militarized zones. Research on the effectiveness of CCTV cameras in the reduction of crime is far from conclusive 13 and, despite concerns over privacy, the technology is as popular as ever. In 2011, for example, it is estimated that there was one camera for every 32 citizens in the UK, operated by the state as well as the private sector. Adding facial recognition and other tracking technology to the mix means that our being in the world is operationalized in ways that are increasingly hard to notice. Many artists, activists, and hackers are working on ways to undermine and distort these technologies or to counteract their effects without impeding human interactions; for example, through caps glowing with ultraviolet light or scarves designed to throw off facial-recognition artificial intelligence (AI) (Francis Hunger; Emily Van Der Nagel).

### Dockray, Sean (2019) Performing Algorithms: Automation and Accident
<a class="getLink" href="/dockray_sean_-_performing_algorithms_-_automation_and_accident(2019).pdf">get</a>
|| abstract
Performing Algorithms: Automation and Accident investigates how artists might stage encounters with the algorithms driving our post-industrial, big-data-based, automatic society. Several important theories of this contemporary condition are discussed, including control societies, post-industrial societies, the automatic society, the cybernetic hypothesis, and algorithmic governmentality. These concepts are interwoven with histories of labour and automation, recent developments in machine learning and neural networks, and my own past work.

Through a series of expanded lecture performances that describe our algorithmic condition while setting it into motion, this research seeks to discover ways in which to advance new critical positions within a totalizing technical apparatus whose very design preempts it. The included creative works have been performed, exhibited, and published between 2014 and 2018. They are made available online through an artificially intelligent chatbot, a frequent figure in the research, which here extends
the concerns of that research through to how the work is framed and presented.

The thesis focuses on both generative art and the lecture performance, which converge in performing algorithms but are generally not discussed in connection with one another. They emerged in parallel as artistic methods, however, at a time when management and computation were taking root in the workplace in the 1960s. Furthermore, as the Internet became widespread from the 1990s, generative art and the lecture performance each found renewed prominence.

With human language and gesture increasingly modelling itself on the language of computation and work constantly reshaped by the innovations of capital, this project identifies “not working” both in terms of the technological breakdown and also as a condition of labour under automation. A discussion of the first fatal accident involving a self-driving vehicle illustrates this dual condition. Shifting from glitch art’s preoccupation with provoking errors to a consideration of not working, this research proposes artistic strategies that learn to occupy rather than display the accident.

### Flake, Gary William (1999) The Computational Beauty of Nature - Computer Explorations of Fractals, Chaos, Complex Systems, and Adaptation

Oft cited book with a friendly introduction to the topics listed in the title. It tries to be witty with the quotes at the start of each chapter:

*The point of philosophy is to start with something so simple as not to seem worth stating, and to end with something so paradoxical that no one will believe it.*
Bertrand Russell

But then has a wealth of information. Check out page 7 for an association map of how topics around complexity relate to one another.

|| Abstract
In this paper an attempt is made to offer a definition of generative art that is inclusive and provides fertile ground for both technical and art theoretical development. First the use of systems is identified as a key element in generative art. Various ideas from complexity theory are then introduced. It is noted that systems exist on a continuum from the highly ordered to the highly disordered. Citing examples from information theory and complexity science, it is noted that highly ordered and highly disordered systems are typically viewed as simple, and complex systems exhibit both order and disorder. This leads to the adoption of effective complexity, order, and disorder as organizing principles in the comparison of various generative art systems. This inclusive view leads to the somewhat surprising observation that generative art is as old as art itself. A number of specific artists and studies are discussed within this systems and complexity theory influenced paradigm. Finally a number of art theoretical questions are introduced to exercise the suggested generative art definition and implicit paradigm.

|| Introduction
I teach a course titled "Foundations of Generative Art Systems" and the most frequent question I am asked is "what is generative art?" Generative art often seems like a fuzzy notion, and most students don't seem to "get it" until very late in the semester. And indeed, in forums such as the eu-gene mailing list (http://www.generative.net) this very question has sparked considerable controversy. In opening this paper I would like to gratefully acknowledge the many discussions on this topic I've had with both my students and the eu-gene online community.
Some might wonder whether the attempt to define generative art is an empty pedantic exercise. I hope that this paper will show that it is not. First clarity of language enhances any discussion, including those about art and specifically generative art. Additionally the discussion of what generative art is stimulates the discussion of other art critical concerns.

### Gleick, James (2008) Chaos - Making a New Science

*The sciences do not try to explain, they hardly even try to interpret, they mainly make models. By a model is meant a mathematical construct which, with the addition of certain verbal interpretations, describes observed phenomena. The justification of such a mathematical construct is solely and precisely that it is expected to work.*
John Von Neumann

> Chaos has become not just theory but also method, not just a canon of beliefs but also a way of doing science. Chaos has created its own technique of using computers, a technique that does not require the vast speed of Crays and Cybers but instead favors modest terminals that allow flexible interaction.

> EVEN NOW, CHAOS THEORY sounds like a bit of an oxymoron. In the 1980s, “chaos” and “theory” were words that didn’t seem to belong in the same room, let alone the same sentence. When friends heard that I was researching a book about chaos—and that it was to do with science—there were quizzical looks and raised eyebrows. Much later, one told me she had thought I was writing about “gas.” As it says in the subtitle, chaos was a new science—strange and alien-sounding, exciting and hard to accept.

A classic worth reading.

### Plummer-Fernandez, Matthew (2018) The art of bots: A practice-based study of the multiplicity, entanglements and figuration of sociocomputational assemblages

PhD thesis of Matthew Plummer-Fernandez, Design Department, Goldsmiths, University of London.

|| Abstract
This thesis examines and analyses an emerging art practice known as artbots. Artbots are internet-based software applications that are imbued with character and configured to engage and entertain online audiences. This form of practice, and the community of practice leading it, was found to be underrepresented and misunderstood. I argue that this artform is original and warrants a more thorough understanding. This thesis develops a conceptual framework for understanding artbots that focuses on and enables questioning around pertinent aspects of the practice. A wide range of literature was reviewed to provide theoretical underpinnings towards this framework, including literature on algorithm studies, science and technology studies, and software architecture. The devised framework examines artbot case studies through the notions of multiplicity, entanglement, and figuration, having understood artbots as heterogenous sociocomputational assemblages comprised of software components and human intra-activity. The research followed a varied methodology that encompassed participant observation and my own practice-based experiments in producing artbots. The study resulted in several original works. In addition, a showcase titled Art of Bots brought together key proponents and artbots, further providing material that is analysed in this thesis. The study helped identify and discuss artbots with attention to how they utilise modular software components in novel arrangements, how normative human and nonhuman relations of interaction are being eschewed in favour of entangled interrelations, and how artbots challenge common narratives dictating technological constructs by inventing unique characters and figurations.

A cellular automata machine is a universe synthesizer. Like an organ, it has keys and stops by which the resources of the instrument can be called into action, combined, and reconfigured. Its color screen is a window through which one can watch the universe that is being "played." 
This book, then, is an introductory harmony and orchestration manual for "composer" of celluar-automaton universe.
