*... [F]or the theory of design is that general theory
of search ... through large combinatorial spaces.*
Herbert Simon (1969)
The sciences of the Artificial

## spaces of possibilities

A concept space can be any set of elements and these can be combined to form say an image or sound or anything else.

What options do we have to explore the space on its possibilities?

- enumeration
- permuation
- rule sets or grammars
- emergence
- chance, randomness
- intuition?

### enumeration
Tom Johnson's Chord catalog
Everyword Alison Parrish, vocabulary space
Every Icon John F. Simon Jr. 1996, pixel space

### permutation
Reordering of sets
Poetry Brion Gysin permutation poems include "I Am That I Am" (1959), "which is a cyclical, randomized representation of the three words contained in that phrase.": I am that I am

### rule sets or grammars
For example L-systems

### emergence
Moire, simple overlay of two simple structures results in a new structure.

### chance, randomness
Given the space use randomness or chance operations to explore the space. Cage, Brown

### intuition
“Intuition is not something that is given. I’ve trained my intuition to accept as obvious shapes which were initially rejected as absurd, and I find everyone else can do the same.”
Benoit Mandelbrot, p.xi
In science (AI/ML) statistics is used to bypass intuition as it is seen as limiting (bias, etc.)

Paul Brown
He recalls his interest at the time in “removing myself from the work and objectifying the
art making process.”
(Whitelaw, p.149)

### face space as example
